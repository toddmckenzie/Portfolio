            <h2>About Me</h4>
            <p>I grew up in a small town in southeast Kansas where sports were my life.  I continued to play sports and wrestled a couple of years in college, but had little idea or direction with what I wanted to do with my life.  I bounced around a little before ending up finished a bachelors degree in Human Biology from Cleveland University Kansas City.  Shortly after graduating I moved to St. Louis to be closer to my girlfriend, who is now my wife.  I started working for a chemical plant as a contracted lab technician.  When that job ended I took an operator position with the company.  I ended up working there for a little over 12 years.  During this period my wife and I had 2 sets of twins.</p>  
            <p>Leaving my job was a difficult one because it paid extremely well, I had people counting on me to make money, and my wife was not working since she was taking care of our 4 children who are 5 and 3.  My wife agreed to work weekends to allow me to pursue my passion.  The reason I left was because I developed a passion for coding.  I started learning python on the side of work and family and I became hooked.  For once in my life I had found an opportunity to do something I enjoyed.  I love learning and making new apps that users love.  I love being stuck on a problem and waking up in the middle of the night with the answer.  I am obsessed with code and want to grow to become the best developer I can obtain.</p>
            <p>I left work to attend Lambda School.  Lambda school is a 30 plus week fulltime fullstack and computer science school.  At lambda I learned HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, responsive web development, Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, jest, express, SQL.  In the computer science portion I learned more python, algorithms, data structures, I learned how to problem solve better, how to read the DOCs, and how to google a little better.  I spent many days working 12 hours a day coding, watching tutotrials through lambda and youtube, and solving problems.  I also continued to work on weekends in order to achieve my goals that I have for myself.</p>
