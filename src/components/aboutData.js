        paragraph: 'I grew up in a small town in southeast Kansas where sports were my life. I played basketball, football, baseball, tennis, soccer, cross country and even wrestled on the college level. Following my passion for human physicality and athleticism, I completed a bachelors degree in Human Biology from Cleveland University Kansas City. Shortly after graduating I moved to be closer to my girlfriend, who is now my wife, in St.Louis, MO. For 12 years, I worked for a chemical plant as a contracted Quality Control lab technician and later an Operator. During this time, my wife and I had 2 sets of twins (yes, you read that right, 4 children!).'

        paragraph: 'In early 2019, I left work to attend Lambda School, a 30+ week long Full Stack Web Development and Computer Science school. At Lambda I learned HTML/CSS, LESS, SASS, Responsive Web Development, Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, Jest, Express, and SQL. In the Computer Science focus, I mastered Python and got deep into algorithms, data structures, computer architecture and more. I learned how to efficiently problem solve and troubleshoot code, how to read the DOCs, and how to google like a developer. I spent many days coding for 12 hours straight, pausing only to watching tutorials, and help my peers troubleshoot their code. Throughout it all, I juggled a family and husband duties.'

        paragraph: 'My journey through Lambda was challenging, but resulted in a deep love for coding. For once in my life, I can truly say I have found an opportunity to pursue something I enjoy in my career. I love learning and making new apps that users love. I love being stuck on a problem and waking up in the middle of the night with the answer. In short, I am obsessed with code and aim to continue to develop into the best developer I can be.'

At FSW I have had the opportunity learn new languages (PHP) and other frameworks (Code Igniter and Laravel).  I have had the chance to work with docker and am currently learning kubernetes.  The opportunity has allowed me to broaden my development experience and work with many experienced developers.'
